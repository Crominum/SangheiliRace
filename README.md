# SangheiliRace Mod Summary

This mod currently adds only the playable sangheilis, which brings some bolstered stats to endure the madness of the Rim.

Hailing originally from the Halo universe, the Sangheili are digitigrade biped saurians with tall, muscular bodies and elongated heads bearing a distinct set four mandibles. Commonly known as 'Elites' by other races, they're known for their warrior culture and combat skill. Their jaws are quadruple-hinged with an upper jaw and a greatly reduced lower jaw which are four mandible-like "lips." Sangheili have two hearts that circulate the signature purple blood through their veins.
